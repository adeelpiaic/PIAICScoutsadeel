Following will be today's class regarding python
Every programs having there own fundamentals
every class have methods
every programming language have operators.
and having all the control loops.
Steps are as follows;
Pre-defined Functions
Pre-defined methods and artributes
Operators
Control loop

to avoid repeatition we use functions.
all functions are pre-defined.

every function is classified

in world everything which have called object.

What is method.
Object which can perform any action called method.

Artributes
Atributes, properties, fileds (in rust language)
Any Property of Object called artributes. 

How to identify functions
every name having small and medium bracket open and close called "function"
Method and function can't being called until unless object is available.
instant, reference and object

still class
couple class

every class having it's own method & artributes

Pre defined Function example
anyname()

Predefined Method example
ref.anyname() 

Artirbutes example
ref.anyname

String class Method and Artributes (String CLASS have 24 Method)
Dictionary
String 
list method have to push on git hub

Method have to operations
Inline (Inline operations doesn't change the original data)
In-memorial

if needs to apply multi line variabl
the code will be written in triple quote

Hard coded text, stream literates
Whenever data needs to change, the source needs to be open by the programmer. this calls hard coded text.
Static application

How to convert static application to dynamic application
Everry static application convert to dynamica application will be put in "Variable"

1) All variables will be in lower case 
2) No space _ will be used instead of space
3) Number will not be used as first word

return function
Non-return function

return function value can be store in any variable.

Non-return function where value can not be stored in any variable.

Operation
Operant
Operator

concatinact is to joint to values
Conatination is an operator
= operator

Example

assign operation
logical operation

% is modula operator
// is used for float division ignore the value after . e.g 3.75 after // 3
** is used for power
= always prefer the new values and ignore the previous value
+=
IN python mathematic operation rule called PEMDAS

Homework
20 Operant
and 18 operator
and shared in group slack AI_MUHAMMAD QASIM
HAMZA MANSOOR SAQIB, HASEEB AND SHARE I.T EXPERT BY SIR QASIM

= equal
== is used for comparison

and in python language is called necessary
or in python language is called optional

If we perofrm operation of addition or contication text with number (integar) will give an error

Zen of python
